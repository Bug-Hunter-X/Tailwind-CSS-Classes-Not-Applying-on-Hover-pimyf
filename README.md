# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying on Hover

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying as expected, specifically on hover events.

## Problem

The provided HTML snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a div.  The `hover:bg-blue-700` class should change the background color to blue when hovering over the element, but it does not work in some cases.

## Solution

The solution might involve checking these points:

1. **Correct Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project (usually `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).  Check for typos in class names.
2. **CSS Specificity:**  If you're using other CSS styles that might conflict, their specificity might override Tailwind's styles. Use !important as the last resort.
3. **Parent Classes:** Problems may arise from parent elements interfering with Tailwind's application. Inspect the hierarchy.
4. **JavaScript Interference:**  Ensure no JavaScript code is inadvertently overriding the Tailwind classes.
5. **Caching Issues:** Clear your browser's cache and hard refresh the page.
6. **Incorrect Import:** Ensure that Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) are correctly included in your CSS entry point.
7. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Mode:**  If you are using JIT, ensure it is working properly.
8. **Purge:** Check the `purge` section in `tailwind.config.js` to confirm that the necessary classes are not being purged.
